    "In this lesson, we will learn how Qiskit stores quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposing the Classical Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything stored on a classical computer is in the form of a number. This includes every letter, color, image, and audio file on the computer you are using right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of those numbers are stored in binary. A binary digit (also called a **bit**) is either a 0 or a 1. This means that all of the information stored on a computer is stored as sequences of 0's and 1's, something like: `00010101010001010.....`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://dagm.io/labfiles/Binary.png\" alt=\"center\" width=\"170\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages (like Python) typically hide these details, so programmers usually don't need to worry about bits. If you want to use the color \"red\", your programming language will be able to use the word `red` instead of the string of bits (like `11111111 00000000 00000000`) that represents \"red\". This makes it much easier to program a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposing the Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum computers** have programming languages, but they have not been developed as far as the programming languages we have for classical computers. Programming for quantum computers involves more of the underlying details and the math. Therefore, to program a quantum computer, it is helpful to learn how quantum computers store information in the form of quantum bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Cell  \n",
